 * 	<b>rta -- ray tracing, again.</b>
 *
 * 	This is yet another ray tracing system, this time with a stronger focus on the actual ray travsersal core.
 * 	Based on previous approaches we try to find a compromise between code duplication and template crazyness.
 * 	This is described greater detail under \ref basic_types, where we explain some design decisions 
 * 		and provide a few guidelines on how you should write your plugins.
 *
 *  The purpose of rta is to provide a testing platform to evaluate different approaches to acceleration structures and ray traversal schemes.
 *  Therefore we provide a common and very slim interface which newly written rta-plugins have to follow.
 *  Beside of making it possible to call such ray tracing components from our framework to allow for easy benchmarking this should
 *  	also make it straightforward to integrate these components into applications requiring such a ray tracing component.
