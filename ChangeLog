* All tracers must implement the following virtual function.  
	virtual bool supports_max_t() = 0 
This way we can check if a tracer can be used for a given purpose (e.g.
shadow rays). Expect some more of these to appear in the future. Note that
constexpr and static_assert will not work as we usually handle objects of
unknown type created in a plugin.
supports_max_t is meant to signify that a tracer honors a predefined maximal
ray length and does not report intersections farther away.
  
* ray_generator now has
	ray_max_t
an image of per-ray maximal ray lengths, accessible via
	max_t(). 
Tracers should honor this information and ray_generators should take care for
its proper initialization.
We introduced
	virtual void dont_forget_to_initialize_max_t() = 0
to find ray generators which do not initialize max_t during generate_rays.
This precaution will be dropped after a while.

* cam_ray_generator_shirley initializes all max_t to FLT_MAX and
bbvh_direct_is_tracer and bbvh_child_is_tracer support this extension.
