* WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR WHEN DEFINING NEW TRACERS / ACCEL_STRUCTS

- usually tracers hold a pointer to the correctly typed acceleration structure.
  if you update the structure you should call
  	rt->acceleration_structure()
  on the trace.
  furthermore, you should take care to override this virtual function in your
  custom tracer to update your pointer.
